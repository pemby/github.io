      This degree is concerning computer information systems related to career skills. I took classes in the CIS (Computer Information Systems) Department, including software analysis, design, programming (in Java and C++), database modeling; I wrote GUI applications in Java and .NET. It advanced usage and configuration of Unix/Linux operating systems, data communications.
